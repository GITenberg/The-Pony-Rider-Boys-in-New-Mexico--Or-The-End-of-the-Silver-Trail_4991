description: What was that?" "Only one of the boys in the seat behind us, snoring."
  "Sure they're asleep?" "Yes, but what if they're not? They are only kids. They wouldn't
  understand." "Don't you be too sure about that. I've heard about those kids. Heard
  about 'em over in Nevada. There's four of them. They call themselves the Pony Rider
  Boys; and they're no tenderfeet, if all I hear is true. They have done some pretty
  lively stunts."
